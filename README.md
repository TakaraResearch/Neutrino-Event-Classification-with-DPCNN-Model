# Neutrino Event Classification with DPCNN Model
This project is developed to provide classification solution for **Background Alpha** and **Neutrino Beta** Events from the 
Jinping Neutrino Experiment.

The **Deep Pyramid Convolution Neural Network(DPCNN)** Method is implemented to generate results **approximate to the dataset 
performance limit**.

Two versions of **Google Colab Notebooks** are designed, optimized and simplified for further research and development, along with 
trained neural network model related. The notebooks are developed to run online, but they also support other notebook setups. 

## WorkPlace Setups
The default working directory is '/content/drive/My Drive'.

In the working directory,
<br>Datasets should be found in './PhysicsData/'.
<br>Models will be saved in './Neutrino_DPCNN_Model/'.
<br>Answers will be produced in './DPCNN_Answers/'.
